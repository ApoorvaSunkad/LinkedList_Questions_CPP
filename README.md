# LinkedList_Questions_CPP
Hi, Here I have uploaded the questions related to the topic linked list.


Uses of Linked List:

1. In the implementation of queues and stacks

//The below examples or uses are of doubly Linked list.

2. Image gallery
3. Music player (To play the next song and previous songs in a playlist)
4. Browser (To go back and front using arrows in a browser)
5. Hashmaps and Hashset (to Handle collisions inside hashmaps where we do chaining when same element occurs)


Arrays vs Linked list

1. Arrays store elements in contiguous manner 
-> but Linked list are not contiguous in manner. which is an advantage

2. Memory wastage or memory crunch is present in Arrays.
-> but in LL no memory wastage  which is also an advantage

3. Access time in arrays is O(1) random access is possible because we know the base address of the array
-> but in LL the random access is not possible because we need to travel the whole LL.  which is an disadvantage of LL

4. Deletion in arrays is expensive bcz if we delete 1 element then we have to move rest of elements to front.
-> In LL we can simply delete and connect the nodes using address
-> Deletion in arrays is O(n) time  which is also an disadvantage
